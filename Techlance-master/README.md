# Techlance
Oct 2017 â€“ Feb 2018  Project descriptionIn this project, I tried to develop a system where all freelancer can find the request of their desired customers to do a particular job and can accept their desired offer. Here, Freelancer will do his required job within client specified days and submit his completed work on this website. Then the customer will receive his work in this website and completes the payment online. JavaSwing, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySql was used for building this system. This work was done during my 4th year undergraduate studies for my Software Development sessional project.
